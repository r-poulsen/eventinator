## FAQ

#### Why not use Google Tasks for the "Purchase tickets" reminder?

The Tasks API doesn't support notifications and setting a time (only a date). From [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/tasks/reference/rest/v1/tasks#Task):

> The due date only records date information; the time portion of the timestamp is discarded when setting the due date. It isn't possible to read or write the time that a task is due via the API.
